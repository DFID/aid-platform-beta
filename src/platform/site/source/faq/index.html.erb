          <h3>Sector, sector group</h3>
          <p>The sector of a contribution answers the question “which specific area of the recipient's economic or social structure is the transfer intended to foster”. A project can have up to 8 Sectors, which are displayed with percentage allocations that total up to 100%. A Sector Group is a grouping of like Sectors. A search on any selected Sector Group / Sector will bring back all projects that work within the relevant Sector criteria specified, regardless of size of the allocation.</p>
          <p>If a Sector group and Sector are chosen as filters, the search will only return results if the project contains both the sector group and the sector. We do not currently display the Sector group/sector hierarchy on the search pages and are looking at this for a future release.</p>
          <p>Note: The sector names presented here are fully consistent with the DAC sector classifications. However, as explained above the sectors published on this website are based on DFID's multisectoral approach. In contrast, when DFID reports to the DAC, we only report one sector per project component (i.e. the one with the highest percentage). This is in line with DAC guidelines and ensures that all donors report consistently.</p>
